# rmagic-filters

These are some filter I've made using Ruby's rmagic gem. 
The initial idea was to use them to improve the results of tesseract-ocr gem, and in fact they can help a little bit, but for the porpouse I intended to use tesseract they didn't work well. 

For now these scripts are just for fun. :)
